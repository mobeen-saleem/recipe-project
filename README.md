This is a recipe page project to showcase basic HTML and CSS skills, containing a homepage and 3 recipe pages. This project has taught me:
- Industry standard HTML boilerplate structure.
- How to structure HTML code.
- The 3 different methods of adding CSS to HTML (as a style.css file in the same folder, inside <style> inside <head>, within HTML tags)
- How to use CSS to change colors and text features (font-style, font-weight, etc).
- How to add images to pages and centre them.
- How to adjust the padding, margin and borders of items on a page.

The homepage (index.html) contains:
- A logo centred at the top of the screen (images generated from: https://cooltext.com/)
- An image centred image, an unordered list of 3 dishes (images generated from: https://designer.microsoft.com/image-creator)
- An unordered list of 3 dishes, seperated and padded.
- CSS styling: background, text color, image border, list item border, list item background color fill

Each recipe page contains: 
- A logo centred at the top of the screen (images generated from: https://cooltext.com/)
- An image centred image, an unordered list of 3 dishes (images generated from: https://designer.microsoft.com/image-creator)
- An unordered list of ingredients with the heading 'Ingredients:'
- An ordered list of recipe instructions
- CSS styling: background color, text color, image color, header styling
